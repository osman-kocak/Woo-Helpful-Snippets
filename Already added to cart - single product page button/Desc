## Custom WooCommerce Add to Cart Text

This code provides a customization for the "Add to Cart" button text on both single product pages and product archives in WooCommerce. The main purpose is to display different text based on whether the product is already in the cart or not.

### Single Product Pages:

The `woo_custom_cart_button_text` function changes the "Add to Cart" text on single product pages. If the product is already in the cart, it will display "Already in Cart - Add Again?".

### Product Archives:

The `woo_archive_custom_cart_button_text` function changes the "Add to Cart" text on product archives. If the product is already in the cart, it will display "Already in Cart".

### How to Use:

1. Integrate these functions into your WordPress theme or plugin.

2. The custom text can be modified by changing the values in the `return` statements.

3. Experience the updated "Add to Cart" button text on single product pages and product archives.
